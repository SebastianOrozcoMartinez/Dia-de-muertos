# Project Overview

This project is a single-page, static website that creates a "Digital Altar" as a tribute. It's a responsive and interactive page that displays different levels of an altar, which can be expanded to show more information.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** The structure of the web page.
*   **CSS:** Custom styling for the altar's appearance and animations.
*   **Bootstrap 5:** For layout and UI components.
*   **JavaScript:** To handle the interactive elements of the altar, such as expanding and collapsing the different levels.

## How to Run

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. No special build steps or servers are required.

## Development Conventions

*   The project uses Bootstrap for its grid system and basic styling.
*   Custom styles are included in a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML document.
*   JavaScript for interactivity is included in a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>`.
*   The code is well-structured and easy to read.
