✦ To ensure we don't lose any progress, here's a summary of our session:

  Current State of `index.html` (based on changes made):

   * Placeholder images and text removed from "Recuerdos" section.
   * "Nivel sin usar" section restored.
   * `<span>` tag formatting in "Nivel 4" marigold line corrected.
   * Images in "Recuerdos" section replaced with `https://via.placeholder.com/300` placeholders and "Imagen de la maestra." descriptions.
   * "Gustos" section text sanitized to "Gusto de la maestra.".
   * "Historia" section text reformatted into two paragraphs for better readability.
   * CSS rule `.accordion-body { text-align: left; }` added to the `<style>` block to left-align accordion text.

  Information Gathered:

   * Maestra Cuquita: Her full name is María del Refugio Rodríguez Ibarra. She was a notable academic at the Centro Universitario del Sur (CUSur) of the University of
     Guadalajara (UDG). She began her teaching career in 1968-1969 and was honored with a mural at CUSur.
   * Instituto Forja: There is a possible connection between María del Refugio Rodríguez Ibarra and "Instituto Forja, A.C." in El Grullo, Jalisco, Mexico, as suggested by
     a municipal document.

  Pending Tasks:

   * Update the index.html file with the gathered information about "Maestra Cuquita" in the "Historia" and "Recuerdos" sections.

  Unresolved Technical Issue:

   * I am currently experiencing a persistent NameError that prevents me from accessing file system tools (like read_file or write_file). This means I cannot read or
     modify index.html until this issue is resolved.

  When you return, please provide this summary back to me. I will then re-attempt to resolve the technical issue and continue with the pending tasks.
